# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The following project has been designed so that:

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Installation

Clone the code into your terminal from the repository.
